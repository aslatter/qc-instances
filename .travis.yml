# We don't have any actual tests.
# However building this across different
# package versions is hard, so that's really
# what we're interested in.

# We've set up GHC 7.4 to look similar to
# debain wheezy and GHC 7.6 to look similar
# to debian jessie.

# Long-term I should probably switch over
# to release of the Haskell Platform to test
# against - the debain-based approach skips
# QuickCheck version 2.6.
